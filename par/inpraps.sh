#Comment line for name
els=(C Hf Zr)			#elements as a bash array
LevMTP=16			#Level of MTP
cmpd_pth=./specialpath/ 	#This is the path you want PRAPs to do stuff in and place all of the output stuff in. Required. Set to $PWD to use the submit_directory. Set to anything else to set a particular path. If you forget, leave blank, or comment out, PRAPs defaults to "install_directory/cmpd".
DFT_CFG=aflow_MTP_CHfZr.cfg	#Name of the .cfg file with DFT-based EFS data, required.
URX_CFG=randspg_MTP_CHfZr.cfg	#Name of the .cfg file without DFT-based EFS data, optional
REF_CFG=ref.cfg			#Name of the .cfg file containing only the individual elemental configs for Hf calcs, optional
mindist=1.1			#Minimum allowed minimum-interatomic-distance, optional, defaults to 1.1 Angstroms
maxdist=3.1			#Maximum allowed minimum-interatomic-distance, optional, defaults to 3.1 Angstroms
chull_var=0.05			#The distance, in eV/atom, above the minimum-energy config that PRAPs will grab for accurate calculations. Optional, defaults to 0.05 eV.
relax_settings="--iteration-limit=100" 	#Any MLIP relaxation settings you want. Optional, recommended to at least include --iteration-limit=100.
training_settings=""    	#Any MLIP training settings you want to use, such as altered weighrs between energies, forces, and stresses, goes in here. Optional, defaults to empty.
basic_acc=false			#Whether or not you want an accurate potential produced by basic training, in addition to the one produced by active learning. Optional, defaults to False.
#CHK=int			#A checkpoint tag to restart a calculation from a particular point in the workflow. Only include if you need it. PRAPs should automatically add this tag as it goes. For example, set CHK=1 if you want to skip the pre-training step. Or set CHK=4 if you only want the convex hull analysis. 
CHULL=true			#Whether or not you want to do the AFLOW-DFT-Convex-hull-plotting section of the analysis. Optional, defaults to False. Note that setting to True will significantly increase the time of your run as the DFT that AFLOW calls takes a lot longer than the MLIP functions.
save_outcars=false		#Optional, defaults to false. If true, this will save all OUTCAR files generated by VASP during the DFT relaxation steps. This is only relevant if CHULL=true. Warning: This will use a lot of disk space and may be redundant.
custom_relax=false		#Optional, defaults to false. If true, this will avoid using AFLOW to manage the DFT relaxations during those steps, allowing users to use their own INCAR settings instead. A pair of INCAR files have been provided for your convenience. Replacements should be named the same: INCAR_rx and INCAR_st for the relaxation and static steps, respectively. Place them in the cmpd_pth directory.
filter_forces=float		#Omit if not wanted. Set to an int/float to perform a force-based filtration. The configs in DFT_CFG will be filtered by their forces to remove all configs with at least one force term outside the range -x < force < x where x is the value defined in this tag. In other words, setting filter_forces=5 will keep all configs whose forces are within the range of -5 to 5. This filtration happens after the distance/volume filtration.
filter_trajectories=false 	#Defaults to false. Setting to true will engage filter_trajectories.py after the robust ALS and before the accurate ALS, within the accurate_potentials.slurm step. This will examine the aflow_MTP_cmpd.cfg file for all of the prototype information. For each prototype, it will only keep the final relaxation step. It will also keep all structures without any OUTCAR/relaxation steps.
filter_volumes=false 		#Defaults to false. Setting to true will engage filter_volumes.py, which will occur immediately after the mindist/maxdist filtering. This will filter out configs in relax.cfg whose volume is too large or too small, as determined by the final volume in a relaxation trajectory and the scaling factor below. Configs without relaxation trajectory information will be allowed through regardless of volume.
volume_scaling=0.25 		#Defaults to 0.25. Use if you set filter_volumes=true. The recommended scaling factor is 0.25 A^3.
ALS_conv=0	#Optional, defaults to the MLIP-reccommended use of N_preselected. Use if you want the active learning process to stop sooner, using different criteria. Your options include: 0=default, stops when no structures are in preselected.cfg. 1=stops when the number of structures selected < 1% of the size of training set. 2=stops when the energy RMSE in meV/atom < $chull_var. 3=stops when the change in energy RMSE in meV/atom < 0.1 meV/atom. 4=stops after 50 iterations. Note that PRAPs will always check for N_preselected = 0 and will stop active learning if it would end sooner than your specified condition.
