#Readme File

First, you will need an installation of Python 3.8+, MLIP 2+, AFLOW 3.2.10+, and VASP 5+, and modules to accompany them.
To install, pick a directory and put everything in here, in there. 
You can put mliputils.py wherever you keep your custom python modules, or keep it in here. 
Just keep track of where it goes in case it's not in here because the pathing is nifty like that.

All the paths you will need:
  pth = The location where you want to install PRAPs, usually the location of this README.
  potpth = The location of your VASP POTCAR files.
  MTPth = The location of the untrained MTP files (look in your MLIP installation dir).
  modpth = The location of your slurm modules, especially MLIP
  email = your email for receiving slurm notifications.
  mlpth = The location to install mliputils.py. Unless you have a favorite location for Python libraries on your system, you can omit this one.

My convention is to omit the final '/' character in paths:
  right = /user/me
  wrong = /user/me/
Of course these are personal preferences, but all of the path variables have been coded with this in mind.

You can either adjust all of the paths yourself or use adjust_paths.py as follows:
  python install.py pth potpth MTPth modpth email mlpth

Finally, make sure to adjust the slurm options in praps.slurm, active_learning.slurm, and accurate_potentials.slurm.


To run PRAPs:
When PRAPs runs, it will cd into a subdirectory named for your system of interest:
    /home/you/PRAPs/ --> /home/you/PRAPs/cmpd
Make sure that the various config files (.cfg files) are already present in there.
Then set-up your inpraps.sh file in your submit directory. This will be imported frequently.
    /home/you/PRAPs/inpraps.sh 
To run PRAPs, make sure you've set your slurm options in praps.slurm and enter:
    sbatch praps.slurm inpraps.sh
NB: This assumes you use slurm. Adjust as needed.
When PRAPs finishes, it will tar all the relevant files together in the cmpd directory, and might clean up a little.

VERY IMPORTANT:
Because MLIP can be compiled in serial or parallel, inspect your installation and your modules, and adjust the input scripts as needed.
--Check your MLIP installation by running, "mlp help". On the second line it will either say "MTPR serial" or "MTPR mpi/parallel"
--For serial MLIP:
----You do not need to load any Intel/OneAPI/OpenMPI/etc.
----You can run MLIP on cluster via the "srun" command.
--For parallel MLIP:
----You need to load Intel/OneAPI/OpenMPI/etc.
----You can run MLIP on cluster via the "mpirun" command.

A sample inpraps.sh has been provided in both the par/ and ser/ directories.
